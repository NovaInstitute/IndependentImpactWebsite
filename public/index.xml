The platform does not prescribe what outcomes must look like; instead, it ensures anyone can understand precisely what every tokenised impact or verifiable credential represents. Participants choose the metrics, methodologies, and assurance levels that fit their context while relying on shared transparency to build confidence.
Participation Independent Impact invites new participants as implementers, validators, verifiers, and methodology developers.</description></item><item><title>Access &amp; Participation</title><link>https://independentimpact.org/pricing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://independentimpact.org/pricing/</guid><description>Participation Model Independent Impact is built to serve a wide community of practitioners, verifiers, and buyers who need confidence in the integrity of impact claims. Rather than traditional software pricing tiers, participation is governed by reputation and the responsibilities each participant assumes.
Reputation-Based Access Roles on the platform—such as implementer, validator, verifier, or methodology developer—carry minimum reputation requirements. Meeting those requirements grants access to associated tools and workflows. Do we have specific thresholds or examples that illustrate how reputation unlocks new capabilities?</description></item><item><title>Data Stewardship</title><link>https://independentimpact.org/privacy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://independentimpact.org/privacy/</guid><description>Commitment to Transparency Independent Impact is built on transparency, yet we have not finalised a public-facing privacy and data stewardship statement. The platform combines decentralised identifiers, verifiable credentials, and distributed storage, which means roles and responsibilities for personal and project data must be clearly articulated.
Information We Need to Publish Data collection practices – What personal or organisational information do we collect during onboarding and participation? Storage and retention – How long are artefacts, credentials, and user records retained, and what options exist for redacting sensitive information while preserving auditability?</description></item><item><title>Impact Workflows</title><link>https://independentimpact.org/features/impact-workflows/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://independentimpact.org/features/impact-workflows/</guid><description>Operational Flow Independent Impact structures the lifecycle of impact claims from initial project conception to tokenisation. Workflows are transparent by default, and each stage leaves an auditable trail linking artefacts, responsible agents, and verification outcomes.
Project Design and Submission Implementers prepare project design documents (PDDs) that describe planned interventions, impact pathways, methodologies, and data requirements. These artefacts are stored on IPFS and referenced within the platform so reviewers can trace every assumption and data source.</description></item><item><title>Participate</title><link>https://independentimpact.org/careers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://independentimpact.org/careers/</guid><description>Join the Independent Impact Community Independent Impact is designed for mass participation. Whether you build projects on the ground, review methodologies, or validate data, there is a pathway for you to contribute to verifiable human impact.
How You Can Contribute Implementers bring forward projects and interventions, documenting their plans and results so they can be evaluated transparently. Validators review project design documents and methodologies to confirm that the proposed evidence and controls are sound.</description></item><item><title>Participation &amp; Governance</title><link>https://independentimpact.org/features/participation-governance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://independentimpact.org/features/participation-governance/</guid><description>Balancing Openness and Quality Independent Impact is founded on the ideal of mass participation in generating shared benefits for all. The platform removes barriers for new contributors while ensuring that quality signals guide the most consequential decisions. Every agent and control earns reputation through community assessment, and that reputation determines the responsibilities they can assume.
Roles Across the Lifecycle Implementers submit projects and carry out interventions, providing the data needed to establish impact.</description></item><item><title>Platform Architecture</title><link>https://independentimpact.org/features/platform-architecture/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://independentimpact.org/features/platform-architecture/</guid><description>Architectural Principles Independent Impact implements technologies that reinforce transparency and accountability at every layer of the impact lifecycle. The stack is intentionally modular so the platform can incorporate new methodologies, data sources, and assurance requirements without sacrificing integrity.
Hedera Consensus Service Hedera Consensus Service captures an immutable, ordered log of platform events. This journal confirms when artefacts were submitted, who evaluated them, and what decisions were taken. It underpins dispute resolution by providing a shared timeline of actions.</description></item><item><title>Terms &amp; Licensing</title><link>https://independentimpact.org/license/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://independentimpact.org/license/</guid><description>We have not yet published licensing or terms of use information for Independent Impact. To help stakeholders understand how they can use the platform and its artefacts, we need clarity on several points:
What legal entity operates Independent Impact, and under which jurisdiction? Is platform access governed by service terms, community charters, or open-source licences? How are methodology contributions, data submissions, and generated tokens licensed for reuse? Do validators, verifiers, or buyers agree to specific codes of conduct or liability limitations?</description></item></channel></rss>
