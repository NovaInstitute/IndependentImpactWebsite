The platform does not prescribe what outcomes must look like; instead, it ensures anyone can understand precisely what every tokenised impact or verifiable credential represents. Participants choose the metrics, methodologies, and assurance levels that fit their context while relying on shared transparency to build confidence.</p><h2 id=participation>Participation</h2><p>Independent Impact invites new participants as implementers, validators, verifiers, and methodology developers. Every action is subject to ongoing peer review, and access to different platform capabilities is governed by reputation requirements. Reputation is earned through meaningful contributions—submitting robust projects, executing activities with integrity, and providing diligent evaluation or verification. The reputations of project creators and the reviewers who assessed them are visible to potential buyers, creating clear accountability.</p><h2 id=reputation-and-governance>Reputation and Governance</h2><p>Balancing openness with quality requires a meritocratic approach. Reputation signals accumulated trust in agents and controls (including methodologies) and determines which responsibilities each participant can accept. Community members continually evaluate artefacts, methodologies, and peer performance, ensuring the platform keeps advancing in rigour while remaining welcoming to new contributors.</p><h2 id=transparency-and-access>Transparency and Access</h2><p>Independent Impact combines secure, immutable storage with easily accessible data services. Artefacts and transactions are recorded using content-addressed storage and distributed ledger technologies, making them tamper-evident and persistent. At the same time, users can query artefacts and events in depth, so they always know how an impact claim was generated, who reviewed it, and which methodologies were applied.</p><h2 id=technology-foundations>Technology Foundations</h2><ul><li><strong>Hedera Consensus Service</strong> for event journaling and tamper-evident sequencing of platform actions.</li><li><strong>W3C Decentralised Identifiers (DID)</strong> to bind activity to accountable agents while enabling open onboarding.</li><li><strong>W3C Verifiable Credentials</strong> to encode attestations that downstream users can independently verify.</li><li><strong>IPFS</strong> for immutable, distributed storage of impact documentation.</li><li><strong>Jellyfish</strong> to provide verifiable compute for transparent, reproducible assessments.</li><li><strong>Fluree</strong> as a cryptographically secured, time-travelable semantic database capturing platform knowledge.</li><li><strong>Hedera Token Service</strong> for issuing transparent, reputation-aware impact tokens.</li></ul><h2 id=current-focus-areas>Current Focus Areas</h2><ul><li>Operating the PDD validation workflow that guides projects from submission to verifiable credential issuance.</li><li>Extending verifiable compute integrations so quantitative assessments remain reproducible and auditable.</li><li>Preparing methodology development workflows and first-mile data collection tools that will broaden the platform’s reach.</li></ul><h2 id=get-involved>Get Involved</h2><p>We are expanding collaborations with organisations that value transparent impact accounting. <em>Who should potential partners contact, and are there priority regions or sectors we should highlight?</em> Until we publish contact details, please reach out through the general address listed in the site footer.</p></article></main><footer class="bg-surface border-t border-border mt-16"><div class="container grid gap-10 py-12 md:grid-cols-3"><div><h2 class="text-lg font-heading font-semibold text-brand-blue-800">Independent Impact</h2></div></div><div class="border-t border-border py-6 text-center text-xs text-body-2">© 2025 Independent Impact.
