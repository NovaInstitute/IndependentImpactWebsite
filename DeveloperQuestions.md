# Developer Questions

The current site reflects the information provided in `referencematerial.md`. To continue development, please help clarify the following items.

## Philosophy & Story

### Questions
- What is the complete list of ontologies released alongside the Anthropogenic Impact Accounting Ontology (AIAO), and who currently stewards them?
- Are there public resources (whitepapers, case studies, repositories) that describe the Guardian cookstove methodology which we can link on the site?
- What outcomes and metrics does the adaptation methodology prioritise, and are there published materials we should reference?
- Can we share milestones or dates for the launch of Independent Impact and the publication of AIAO?

### Answers

- The Ontologies are: 1. Anthropogenic Impact Accounting Ontology (AIAO) housed at https://w3id.org/aiao, 2. Impact Ontology https://w3id.org/impactont , 3. Claim Ontology (https://w3id.org/claimont) 4. Information Communication Ontology https://w3id.org/infocomm. All were developed with the Standards Working Group of the Climate Action and Accounting Special Interest Group of the Linux Foundation Decentralized Trust (https://www.lfdecentralizedtrust.org/)
- The Aartum whitepaper is at https://aartum.io/pdf/aartum_programme_whitepaper_ver5. A video on the Cookstove work is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQRoSuIp5UE&t=81s . I will add more later. 
- The Adaptation methodology with a worked-out example with real data is in the References directory as Methodology.pdf
- AIAO was published in September 2025. 
  

## Participation & Governance

### Questions
- Which contact details (email addresses, forms, or partner portals) should prospective collaborators use? Are there priority regions or sectors to highlight?
- What onboarding process should new participants follow? Do we have training materials or documentation to link?
- What reputation thresholds or levels gate responsibilities such as validation, verification, or methodology authorship?
- How are disputes or appeals about reputation handled within the community governance model?

### Answers
- All enquiries can go to christiaan.pauw@nova.org.za
- We don't have training materials yet, but please make sure there is an onboarding page - I will still provide more content
- The exact details of the reputation system are part of the roadmap - make a roadmap page where we can expand on this
- Disputes or appeals about reputation are also part of the roadmap. Please add "detailed formulation of reputation mechanism", "reputation system beta testing", "Reputation system live" on the roadmap. 

## Access, Costs & Incentives
### Questions
- Are there platform fees, token issuance costs, or evaluator compensation models that we should communicate? If so, how are these structured?
- Do we offer programmes that support new regions, sectors, or community-led initiatives when they join Independent Impact?

### Answers
- While we are in testing on the Hedera testnet, no fees apply. When moving to Heera mainnet, Hbar or custom tokens (via HIP 991) will be used on every transaction. Since Hedera is a very efficient network, we aim to keep fees low. 


## Data Stewardship & Legal
- What personal or organisational data do we collect during onboarding and ongoing participation?
- How long are artefacts, credentials, and user records retained, and can sensitive information be redacted while preserving auditability?
- Who can query artefacts, credentials, and reputation data? Are there permission tiers beyond reputation requirements?
- Which third-party systems (e.g., storage providers, analytics platforms) process participant data, and what agreements govern that use?
- How can participants request corrections, challenge records, or appeal reputation changes tied to personal data?
- Which legal entity operates Independent Impact, and under which jurisdiction?
- Are platform interactions governed by specific terms of service, community charters, or open-source licences?
- How are methodology contributions, submitted data, and issued tokens licensed for reuse?
- Do validators, verifiers, or buyers agree to codes of conduct or liability limitations we should publish?

## Communications & Content
- Which topics should we prioritise for the Insights (blog) section, and are there publication timelines we need to meet?
- Can we confirm or replace the placeholder contact email `info@independentimpact.example` with a production address?
