# Developer Questions

The current site reflects the information provided in `referencematerial.md`. To continue development, please help clarify the following items.

## Philosophy & Story

### Questions
- What is the complete list of ontologies released alongside the Anthropogenic Impact Accounting Ontology (AIAO), and who currently stewards them?
- Are there public resources (whitepapers, case studies, repositories) that describe the Guardian cookstove methodology which we can link on the site?
- What outcomes and metrics does the adaptation methodology prioritise, and are there published materials we should reference?
- Can we share milestones or dates for the launch of Independent Impact and the publication of AIAO?

### Answers

- The Ontologies are: 1. Anthropogenic Impact Accounting Ontology (AIAO) housed at https://w3id.org/aiao, 2. Impact Ontology https://w3id.org/impactont , 3. Claim Ontology (https://w3id.org/claimont) 4. Information Communication Ontology https://w3id.org/infocomm. All were developed with the Standards Working Group of the Climate Action and Accounting Special Interest Group of the Linux Foundation Decentralized Trust (https://www.lfdecentralizedtrust.org/)
- The Aartum whitepaper is at https://aartum.io/pdf/aartum_programme_whitepaper_ver5. A video on the Cookstove work is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQRoSuIp5UE&t=81s . I will add more later. 
- The Adaptation methodology with a worked-out example with real data is in the References directory as Methodology.pdf
- AIAO was published in September 2025. 
  

## Participation & Governance
- Which contact details (email addresses, forms, or partner portals) should prospective collaborators use? Are there priority regions or sectors to highlight?
- What onboarding process should new participants follow? Do we have training materials or documentation to link?
- What reputation thresholds or levels gate responsibilities such as validation, verification, or methodology authorship?
- How are disputes or appeals about reputation handled within the community governance model?

## Methodology & Assurance
- Which methodologies are ready for publication on the platform, and which are still in peer review?
- Do we maintain a roadmap of upcoming ontologies or taxonomies that should align with AIAO?
- What validation evidence is required before issuing credentials for new methodologies or impact indicators?
- How should we describe the relationship between verifiable compute workflows and manual validation steps?

## Access, Costs & Incentives
- Are there platform fees, token issuance costs, or evaluator compensation models that we should communicate? If so, how are these structured?
- Do we offer programmes that support new regions, sectors, or community-led initiatives when they join Independent Impact?

## Data Stewardship & Legal
- What personal or organisational data do we collect during onboarding and ongoing participation?
- How long are artefacts, credentials, and user records retained, and can sensitive information be redacted while preserving auditability?
- Who can query artefacts, credentials, and reputation data? Are there permission tiers beyond reputation requirements?
- Which third-party systems (e.g., storage providers, analytics platforms) process participant data, and what agreements govern that use?
- How can participants request corrections, challenge records, or appeal reputation changes tied to personal data?
- Which legal entity operates Independent Impact, and under which jurisdiction?
- Are platform interactions governed by specific terms of service, community charters, or open-source licences?
- How are methodology contributions, submitted data, and issued tokens licensed for reuse?
- Do validators, verifiers, or buyers agree to codes of conduct or liability limitations we should publish?

## Communications & Content
- Which topics should we prioritise for the Insights (blog) section, and are there publication timelines we need to meet?
- Can we confirm or replace the placeholder contact email `info@independentimpact.example` with a production address?
