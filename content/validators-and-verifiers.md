## Upholding assurance

Validators and verifiers ensure that every impact credential is grounded in transparent evidence. Independent Impact records evaluation workflows on the Hedera Consensus Service so that your assessments remain immutable and auditable. Before you accept an assignment, review:

- The methodology in scope, including reputation requirements for evaluators.
- Documentation stored on IPFS or linked repositories.
- Any conflict-of-interest disclosures from the project team.

## Running your review

When validating or verifying a project:

1. **Inspect artefacts** – Confirm that baseline data, implementation records, and safeguard evidence align with methodology expectations.
2. **Reproduce computations** – Use provided scripts or verifiable compute pipelines to re-run calculations and confirm outputs.
3. **Evaluate governance** – Check whether project developers met stakeholder engagement and consent requirements.
4. **Issue attestations** – Publish findings as verifiable credentials, including conditions or corrective actions where necessary.

Your reputation increases when reviews are thorough, transparent, and well-documented. Downstream stakeholders can see who verified each impact, so clarity matters.

## Building the validator network

Independent Impact is curating a directory of domain experts who can support new sectors, regions, and methodologies. We are gathering more information on:

- Training materials or certifications that validators should complete before working on specialised methodologies.
- Compensation models or cooperative structures that help verifiers remain independent.
- How disputes or appeals should be escalated when reviewers reach different conclusions.
