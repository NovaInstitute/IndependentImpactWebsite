## Commitment to Transparency

Independent Impact is built on transparency, yet we have not finalised a public-facing privacy and data stewardship statement. The platform combines decentralised identifiers, verifiable credentials, and distributed storage, which means roles and responsibilities for personal and project data must be clearly articulated.

## Information We Need to Publish

- **Data collection practices** – _What personal or organisational information do we collect during onboarding and participation?_
- **Storage and retention** – _How long are artefacts, credentials, and user records retained, and what options exist for redacting sensitive information while preserving auditability?_
- **Access controls** – _Who can query artefacts, credentials, and reputational data, and are there tiered permissions beyond reputation-based capabilities?_
- **Third-party services** – _Which external systems (e.g., storage providers, analytics) handle data, and what agreements govern their usage?_
- **Participant rights** – _How can participants request corrections, challenge records, or appeal reputation changes that rely on personal data?_

Once these details are confirmed we will publish a comprehensive policy that aligns with the platform’s philosophy of openness, accountability, and respect for contributors.
