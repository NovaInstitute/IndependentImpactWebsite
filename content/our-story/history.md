Independent Impact grows from a decade of experimentation in verifiable impact accounting. Highlights include:

### Aartum Whitepaper

The [Aartum Whitepaper](https://aartum.io/pdf/aartum_programme_whitepaper_ver5) articulated the vision that unique cryptographic representations of verified communal benefits could function as symbols of value, while calling out veracity as the central challenge for blockchain-based impact ecosystems.

### Anthropogenic Impact Accounting Ontology

The *Anthropogenic Impact Accounting Ontology* (AIAO) resulted from collaborative work in the Hyperledger Climate Action and Accounting SIG to define a foundational ontology for anthropogenic impact accounting, enabling comparison across methodologies and metrics. The Standards Working Group of the Linux Foundation Decentralized Trust continues to steward four related ontologies:

- [Anthropogenic Impact Accounting Ontology](https://w3id.org/aiao)
- [Impact Ontology](https://w3id.org/impactont)
- [Claim Ontology](https://w3id.org/claimont)
- [Information Communication Ontology](https://w3id.org/infocomm)

These ontologies provide the formal basis for Independent Impact and make it possible to do impact accounting across different impacts and domains in a consistent manner.

### Guardian Cookstove Methodology

This methodology demonstrates how rigorous methods can be executed within open verification workflows. Explore the methodology in practice through our [cookstove case study video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQRoSuIp5UE&t=81s).

### Adaptation Methodology

The adaptation methodology extends the platform beyond mitigation use cases. A worked example with real project data is available in the [Adaptation Methodology reference](/References/Methodology.pdf).

### Publication of AIAO

The formal release of AIAO to the wider community in September 2025 established shared language for anthropogenic impact—one of the building blocks for Independent Impact.
