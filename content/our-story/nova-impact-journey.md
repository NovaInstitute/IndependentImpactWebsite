Independent Impact is an initiative of the Nova Institute, an independent not-for-profit company based in South Africa with a track record spanning three decades. Nova's vision is the well-being of households—especially low-income households—in Southern Africa. Nova works in a transdisciplinary way with households, community structures, governments, NGOs, and businesses to develop and implement practical solutions that improve quality of life.

Impact quantification has been a core part of Nova's work since its inception. The team has pioneered methodologies for quantifying the impacts of household interventions on greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution exposure, and quality of life.

Independent Impact grows from a decade of experimentation in verifiable impact accounting. The platform brings together these lessons with modern verification tooling so partners can trust the outcomes they see.
