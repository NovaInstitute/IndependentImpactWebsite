title="The problem we saw"
description="Traditional impact reporting and verification systems are slow, expensive, and monopolised, placing heavy financial and technical barriers in front of smaller or locally rooted initiatives. Verifiers often lack local knowledge, and methodologies can be limited or misaligned with the real issues. The result is a system that rewards scale over integrity, privileges middle-men over households, and leaves impact claims difficult to compare, trust, or verify."

title="The approach we are taking"
description="Independent Impact aims to turn this model on its head using two principles: *everything should be transparent* and *everything can be evaluated*.
Having Transparency as the basis of the ecosystems makes auditing faster and thus cheaper. By emphasising radical transparency, we can simultainiously maintain flexibility and avoid monopolies based on the authoroty of so-called experts. When each action and artefact is transparent, users do not have to blindly believe so-called experts but can decide for themselves how to value the outcomes.<br> Independent Impact is based on the idea that agents, methods and artefacts all acrue reputation by on-going peer review. Through their participation and contributions, participants will acrue reputation for their field of expertise. Evaluation is ongoing and multi-dimensional. The traditional model has VVBs (Validation and Verification Bodies). We emphasise the validation and verification process where multiple agents evaluate multiple aspects. For example: Different aspects of a project can be evaluated by a local resident (fact checking the local implementation claims of a project) and a technical expert (evaluating the design). The reputation of the project reflects the evaluations received, taking into account the reputation of the evaluators. <br> We believe in community. A reputation-based system, built on the expertise of practitioners who understand local contexts, can systematically and reliably validate and verify impact. We are building the technology that simplifies the process, strengthens transparency, and builds lasting trust."
