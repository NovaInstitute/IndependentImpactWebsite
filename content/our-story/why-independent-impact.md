title="The problem we saw"
description="Traditional impact reporting and verification systems are slow, expensive, and monopolised, placing heavy financial and technical barriers in front of smaller or locally rooted initiatives. Verifiers often lack local knowledge, and methodologies can be limited or misaligned with the real issues. The result is a system that rewards scale over integrity, privileges middle-men over households, and leaves impact claims difficult to compare, trust, or verify."

Independent Impact aims to turn this model on its head using two principles: *everything should be transparent* and *everything can be evaluated*.

Having transparency as the basis of the ecosystem makes auditing faster and thus cheaper. By emphasising radical transparency, we can simultaneously maintain flexibility and avoid monopolies based on the authority of so-called experts. When each action and artefact is transparent, users do not have to blindly believe so-called experts but can decide for themselves how to value the outcomes.

Independent Impact is based on the idea that agents, methods, and artefacts all accrue reputation through ongoing peer review. Participants earn reputation in their fields of expertise as they contribute. Evaluation is multi-dimensional: the traditional model relies on VVBs (Validation and Verification Bodies), while we emphasise validation and verification workflows where multiple agents assess different aspects. For example, a local resident can fact-check on-the-ground implementation claims while a technical expert evaluates the design. A projectâ€™s reputation reflects the evaluations it receives, taking into account the reputation of evaluators.

We believe in community. A reputation-based system, built on the expertise of practitioners who understand local contexts, can systematically and reliably validate and verify impact. We are building technology that simplifies the process, strengthens transparency, and builds lasting trust.
