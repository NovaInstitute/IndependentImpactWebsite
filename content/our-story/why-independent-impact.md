## The problem we saw

Traditional impact reporting and verification systems are slow, expensive, and monopolised, placing heavy financial and technical barriers in front of smaller or locally rooted initiatives. Verifiers often lack local knowledge, and methodologies can be limited or misaligned with the real issues. The result is a system that rewards scale over integrity, privileges middle-men over households, and leaves impact claims difficult to compare, trust, or verify.

## The approach we are taking

Independent Impact turns this model on its head. Creating impact is hard enough without having to jump through endless hoops to prove it. Verification should enable changemakers, not stifle them. It should ensure that investments reach the ground where they matter most and help those driving change achieve their aims.

We believe in community. A reputation-based system, built on the expertise of practitioners who understand local contexts, can systematically and reliably validate and verify impact. We believe this can be done using technology that simplifies the process, strengthens transparency, and builds lasting trust.

That is why we are building Independent Impact.
