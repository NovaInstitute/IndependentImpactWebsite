## Current Capabilities

Independent Impact already operates several production-grade components:

- **Hedera Consensus Service integration** – Registration events, project submissions, validation checkpoints, and credential issuances are immutably sequenced on HCS.
- **Identity and access** – Participants can register, associate decentralised identifiers (DIDs), and earn role-based permissions aligned with their reputation.
- **Project design document workflow** – Project developers draft, submit, and revise PDDs with validators providing paragraph-level feedback until approval.
- **Credential issuance** – Completed validations and verifications result in verifiable credentials that downstream partners can inspect and trust.

## In Progress

- **Reputation system** – Weighted indicators for projects, methodologies, and participants will surface on public profiles so collaborators understand assurance levels at a glance.
- **First mile data collection** – Tooling for local field agents to capture photo, sensor, and survey evidence is under construction, anchoring submissions with verifiable provenance.
- **AI-powered impact browser** – Natural-language search, contextual explanations, and auto-generated queries will help stakeholders explore the growing body of impact data.

## Planned Expansions

- **Indicators & metrics library** – A shared registry where subject-matter experts publish, debate, and finalise impact indicators and metrics.
- **Methodology development workspace** – Collaborative tooling for authoring methodologies, tracking revisions, and approving final versions.
- **Rapid implementation toolkit** – Templates, training materials, and monitoring dashboards that help community projects get up and running quickly.
- **Public reporting platform** – Rich discovery and reporting interfaces so regulators, funders, and the public can interrogate verified outcomes.
