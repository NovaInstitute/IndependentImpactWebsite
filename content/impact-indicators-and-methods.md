## Why methodologies matter

Impact accounting is only as strong as the methodologies that underpin it. Independent Impact stewards open, peer-reviewed frameworks that explain how outcomes are measured, which data sources are required, and what quality controls apply. The Anthropogenic Impact Accounting Ontology (AIAO) and the related Impact, Claim, and Information Communication ontologies provide the semantic backbone that lets every participant interpret results consistently.

## Building reliable indicators

Methodologies published on the platform describe:

- **Indicators and metrics** – Quantitative or qualitative measures mapped to AIAO concepts so that claims can be compared across contexts.
- **Data requirements** – Evidence, field measurements, and community attestations that must be collected for each claim.
- **Computation steps** – Reference calculations, including verifiable compute workflows, that transform raw inputs into final indicators.
- **Assurance pathways** – Validation and verification steps that specify reputation thresholds, documentation standards, and dispute processes.

## Participating in methodology development

Independent Impact is expanding the methodology development workflow. Contributors can propose new methodologies, adapt existing ones to new regions, or provide counterfactual analyses for emerging impact sectors. Reputation signals guide who can authorise publication-ready versions. To help us prioritise support, we are currently seeking details on:

- Upcoming ontologies or taxonomies that should interoperate with AIAO.
- Methodologies that require translation or localisation to serve new communities.
- Datasets or APIs that should be integrated into verifiable compute pipelines.
