## How to engage

Whether you are developing a new project, authoring a methodology, or offering validation expertise, Independent Impact wants to hear from you. Use this page as your checklist before reaching out:

1. **Summarise your initiative** – Outline the community, outcomes, and timeframe you are working toward.
2. **Reference your methodology** – Link to existing guidance or describe the evidence you plan to collect.
3. **List collaborators** – Include participating organisations, local partners, and any validators already involved.
4. **Highlight support needs** – Tell us which tools, ontologies, or governance processes you need to advance your work.

## Submission channels

Until we publish dedicated intake forms, please reach us through the contact address in the footer. In your message, let us know:

- Whether you want to publish a new project, propose a methodology, or join the validator network.
- Which regions or sectors you operate in and any language considerations we should be aware of.
- If there are sensitive datasets or privacy requirements we should plan for.

## What happens next

We review submissions on a rolling basis and match them with reviewers who have relevant reputation. You will receive guidance on:

- Preparing artefacts for IPFS or other content-addressed storage.
- Setting up verifiable compute pipelines where quantitative analysis is required.
- Navigating reputation thresholds for validation, verification, and publication.

Ready to collaborate? Send us your details and we will guide you through the Independent Impact onboarding process.
