We have not yet published licensing or terms of use information for Independent Impact. To help stakeholders understand how they can use the platform and its artefacts, we need clarity on several points:

- _What legal entity operates Independent Impact, and under which jurisdiction?_ 
- _Is platform access governed by service terms, community charters, or open-source licences?_
- _How are methodology contributions, data submissions, and generated tokens licensed for reuse?_
- _Do validators, verifiers, or buyers agree to specific codes of conduct or liability limitations?_

Once we receive guidance on these questions we can publish formal documentation that aligns with the platformâ€™s philosophy of openness and accountability.
