## Active Capabilities

- **PDD validation workflow** – end-to-end process for submitting project design documents, coordinating peer validation, and issuing verifiable credentials backed by reputation scores.
- **Verifiable compute integrations** – reproducible execution of assessment logic using Jellyfish to maintain trust in quantitative outcomes.

## Roadmap

- **Methodology development workflow** – collaborative tools for designing, reviewing, and approving new methodologies within the reputation system.
- **Reputation ecosystem expansion** – deeper incentives and transparency for how agents earn, lose, and apply reputation across roles.
- **First-mile data collection** – field applications that feed trustworthy, verifiable data directly into the Independent Impact ecosystem.
