## History

Independent Impact grows from a decade of experimentation in verifiable impact accounting. Highlights include:

- **Aartum Whitepaper** – articulated the vision that unique cryptographic representations of verified communal benefits could function as symbols of value, while calling out veracity as the central challenge for blockchain-based impact ecosystems.
- **AIAO Ontology** – collaborative work in the Hyperledger Climate Action and Accounting SIG to define a foundational ontology for anthropogenic impact accounting, enabling comparison across methodologies and metrics. _What is the full list of published ontologies and their current stewardship?_ 
- **Guardian cookstove methodology** – demonstrates how rigorous methodologies can be executed within open verification workflows. _Do we have public resources or links describing this methodology?_
- **Launch of Independent Impact** – initiated the platform that operationalises reputation, transparency, and verifiable compute for real-world impact accounting.
- **Adaptation methodology** – extends the platform beyond mitigation use cases. _What outcomes and metrics does the adaptation methodology currently prioritise?_
- **Publication of AIAO** – formal release of the ontology to the wider community, establishing shared language for anthropogenic impact.

## Active Capabilities

- **PDD validation workflow** – end-to-end process for submitting project design documents, coordinating peer validation, and issuing verifiable credentials backed by reputation scores.
- **Verifiable compute integrations** – reproducible execution of assessment logic using Jellyfish to maintain trust in quantitative outcomes.

## Roadmap

- **Methodology development workflow** – collaborative tools for designing, reviewing, and approving new methodologies within the reputation system.
- **Reputation ecosystem expansion** – deeper incentives and transparency for how agents earn, lose, and apply reputation across roles.
- **First-mile data collection** – field applications that feed trustworthy, verifiable data directly into the Independent Impact ecosystem.
