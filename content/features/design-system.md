## Balancing Openness and Quality

Independent Impact is founded on the ideal of mass participation in generating shared benefits for all. The platform removes barriers for new contributors while ensuring that quality signals guide the most consequential decisions. Every agent and control earns reputation through community assessment, and that reputation determines the responsibilities they can assume.

### Roles Across the Lifecycle

- **Implementers** submit projects and carry out interventions, providing the data needed to establish impact.
- **Validators** review methodologies and project design documents, assessing whether evidence and controls are sufficient.
- **Verifiers** confirm that reported outcomes align with the agreed methodologies and that data provenance is intact.
- **Methodology developers** design and iterate on the frameworks others use to measure and assure impact.

### Reputation as a Governance Layer

Reputation is the connective tissue that keeps the ecosystem accountable. Contributors gain standing by delivering reliable work, whether through meticulous project documentation or thorough evaluations. Reputations decay or are challenged when contributions fall short, encouraging continual improvement and truth-seeking dialogue.

### Visibility for Buyers and Partners

Prospective buyers can inspect not only the impact tokens or verifiable credentials themselves, but also the reputations of the agents involved in creating and validating them. This transparency fosters trust and helps partners decide whether a particular impact claim aligns with their own assurance requirements.

### Open Questions

_What thresholds or levels currently gate access to key responsibilities, and how are disputes over reputation resolved?_ Clarifying these processes will help us document onboarding pathways and governance mechanics more completely.
