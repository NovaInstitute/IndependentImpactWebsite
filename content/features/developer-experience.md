## Operational Flow

Independent Impact structures the lifecycle of impact claims from initial project conception to tokenisation. Workflows are transparent by default, and each stage leaves an auditable trail linking artefacts, responsible agents, and verification outcomes.

### Project Design and Submission

Implementers prepare project design documents (PDDs) that describe planned interventions, impact pathways, methodologies, and data requirements. These artefacts are stored on IPFS and referenced within the platform so reviewers can trace every assumption and data source.

### Peer Validation

Validators with sufficient reputation review submitted PDDs, assessing whether methodologies align with stated goals and whether proposed controls are adequate. Their evaluations are issued as verifiable credentials, giving downstream users a cryptographically signed record of the decision.

### Execution and Monitoring

As projects proceed, implementers submit monitoring data and supporting evidence. Jellyfish-powered compute pipelines transform these inputs into quantitative impact assessments, generating reproducible outputs that others can inspect.

### Field Data Collection

Individuals based near implementation sites capture first-mile evidence such as photos, logs, or site observations. Each deliverable is submitted into the platform, providing verifiable, time-stamped data while also creating an income-earning opportunity at the local level.

### Verification and Tokenisation

Verifiers examine the evidence, recompute results when necessary, and confirm that methodologies were followed. Once validations and verifications meet reputation thresholds, impacts can be tokenised via the Hedera Token Service, linking each token to its provenance trail.

### Future Enhancements

- Methodology development workflows will allow community members to propose, iterate, and approve new methodologies within the same reputation framework.
- First-mile data collection apps will capture field data directly into the platform, strengthening the integrity of evidence from the outset.
