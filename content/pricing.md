## Participation Model

Independent Impact is built to serve a wide community of practitioners, verifiers, and buyers who need confidence in the integrity of impact claims. Rather than traditional software pricing tiers, participation is governed by reputation and the responsibilities each participant assumes.

### Reputation-Based Access

Roles on the platform—such as implementer, validator, verifier, or methodology developer—carry minimum reputation requirements. Meeting those requirements grants access to associated tools and workflows. _Do we have specific thresholds or examples that illustrate how reputation unlocks new capabilities?_

### Costs and Fees

We have not yet published information about platform fees, token issuance costs, or compensation for evaluators. _What fee structures, if any, should we communicate to prospective participants and buyers?_ Once confirmed, this section will outline how costs are allocated across the ecosystem.

### Support for Communities

Independent Impact’s goal is to make verifiable impact accessible to communities everywhere. _Are there programmes for supporting new regions, sectors, or community-led initiatives that we should highlight here?_ Sharing these details will help prospective partners understand how to get involved.
