## History

Independent Impact grows from a decade of experimentation in verifiable impact accounting. Highlights include:

- **Aartum Whitepaper** – articulated the vision that unique cryptographic representations of verified communal benefits could function as symbols of value, while calling out veracity as the central challenge for blockchain-based impact ecosystems. Read the original paper at [aartum.io/pdf/aartum_programme_whitepaper_ver5](https://aartum.io/pdf/aartum_programme_whitepaper_ver5).
- **AIAO Ontology** – collaborative work in the Hyperledger Climate Action and Accounting SIG to define a foundational ontology for anthropogenic impact accounting, enabling comparison across methodologies and metrics. The Standards Working Group of the Linux Foundation Decentralized Trust continues to steward AIAO alongside the [Impact Ontology](https://w3id.org/impactont), [Claim Ontology](https://w3id.org/claimont), and [Information Communication Ontology](https://w3id.org/infocomm).
- **Guardian cookstove methodology** – demonstrates how rigorous methodologies can be executed within open verification workflows. Explore the methodology in practice through our [cookstove case study video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQRoSuIp5UE&t=81s).
- **Launch of Independent Impact** – initiated the platform that operationalises reputation, transparency, and verifiable compute for real-world impact accounting.
- **Adaptation methodology** – extends the platform beyond mitigation use cases. A worked example with real project data is available in the [Adaptation Methodology reference](/References/Methodology.pdf).
- **Publication of AIAO** – formal release of the ontology to the wider community in September 2025, establishing shared language for anthropogenic impact.
