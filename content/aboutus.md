# Our Story

# Why Independent Impact
Traditional impact reporting and verification systems are slow, expensive, and monopolised, placing heavy financial and technical barriers in front of smaller or locally rooted initiatives. Verifiers often lack local knowledge, and methodologies can be limited and misaligned with the real issues. The result is a system that rewards scale over integrity, privileges middle-men over households, and leaves impact claims difficult to compare, trust, or verify.

Independent Impact turns this model on its head. Creating impact is hard enough without having to jump through endless hoops to prove it. Verification should enable changemakers, not stifle them. It should ensure that investments reach the ground where they matter most, and help those driving change achieve their aims.

We believe in community. A reputation-based system, built on the expertise of practitioners who understand local contexts, can systematically and reliably validate and verify impact. We believe this can be done using technology that simplifies the process, strengthens transparency, and builds lasting trust. 

That is why we are building Independent Impact.

## The Nova Institute's Impact Journey

Independent Impact is an initiative of the Nova Institute, an independent not for profit company based in South Africa Wwith a track record spanning three decades.  Nova's vision is the well-being of households, especially low-income households, in Southern Africa. Nova works in a transdisciplinary way with a broad group of stakeholders including, households, community structures, governments, NGOs, and businesses to develop and implement practical solutions to improve quality of life.

Impact quantification has been a core part of Nova's work since its inception. Nova has pioneered methodologies for quantifying the impacts of household interventions on greenhouse gas emission, air pollution exposure and quality of live.

### History

Independent Impact grows from a decade of experimentation in verifiable impact accounting. Highlights include:

#### Aartum Whitepaper
The [Aartum Whitepaper](https://aartum.io/pdf/aartum_programme_whitepaper_ver5) articulated the vision that unique cryptographic representations of verified communal benefits could function as symbols of value, while calling out veracity as the central challenge for blockchain-based impact ecosystems.

#### AIAO Ontology

The *Antropogenic Impact Accounting Ontology* (AIAO) resulted from collaborative work in the Hyperledger Climate Action and Accounting SIG to define a foundational ontology for anthropogenic impact accounting, enabling comparison across methodologies and metrics. The Standards Working Group of the Linux Foundation Decentralized Trust continues to steward four related ontologies:

- [Antropogenic Impact Accounting Ontology](https://w3id.org/aiao) 
- [Impact Ontology](https://w3id.org/impactont) 
- [Claim Ontology](https://w3id.org/claimont) 
- [Information Communication Ontology](https://w3id.org/infocomm) 

These ontologies provide the formal basis for Independent Impact an make it possible to do imopact accounting across different impacts and domains in a consistent manner.

#### Guardian cookstove methodology

This methodology demonstrates how rigorous methodologies can be executed within open verification workflows. Explore the methodology in practice through our [cookstove case study video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQRoSuIp5UE&t=81s). Our exeprience 


#### Adaptation methodology

The  extends the platform beyond mitigation use cases. A worked example with real project data is available in the [Adaptation Methodology reference](/References/Methodology.pdf).

- **Publication of AIAO** â€“ formal release of the ontology to the wider community in September 2025, establishing shared language for anthropogenic impact.

## Team

The core functionality of Independent Impact is being built by a team from the Nova Institute, with support from a independent collaborators. As the platform matures and the reputation system becomes active in different parts of the platform, we will explore with more decentralised governance models.
