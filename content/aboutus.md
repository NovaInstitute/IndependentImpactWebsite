# About Us

## Initiative

Independent Impact is an initiative of the Nova Institute, an independent not for profit company founded in 1994 and based in South Africa. Nova's vision is the well-being of households, especially low-income households, in Southern Africa. Nova works in a transdisciplinary way with a broad group of stakeholders including, households, community structures, governments, NGOs, and businesses to develop and implement practical solutions to improve quality of life.

Impact quantification has been a core part of Nova's work since its inception. Nova has pioneered methodologies for quantifying the impacts of household interventions on greenhouse gas emission, air pollution exposure and quality of live.

## Team

The core functionality of Independent Impact is being built as by a team from the Nova Institute, with support from a independent collaborators. As the platform matures and the reputation system becomes active in different parts of the platform, we will explore with more decentralised governance models.

## History

Independent Impact grows from a decade of experimentation in verifiable impact accounting. Highlights include:

### Aartum Whitepaper
The [Aartum Whitepaper](https://aartum.io/pdf/aartum_programme_whitepaper_ver5) articulated the vision that unique cryptographic representations of verified communal benefits could function as symbols of value, while calling out veracity as the central challenge for blockchain-based impact ecosystems.

### AIAO Ontology

The *Antropogenic Impact Accounting Ontology* (AIAO) resulted from collaborative work in the Hyperledger Climate Action and Accounting SIG to define a foundational ontology for anthropogenic impact accounting, enabling comparison across methodologies and metrics. The Standards Working Group of the Linux Foundation Decentralized Trust continues to steward four related ontologies:

- [Antropogenic Impact Accounting Ontology](https://w3id.org/aiao) 
- [Impact Ontology](https://w3id.org/impactont) 
- [Claim Ontology](https://w3id.org/claimont) 
- [Information Communication Ontology](https://w3id.org/infocomm) 

These ontologies provide the formal basis for Independent Impact an make it possible to do impact accounting across different impacts and domains in a consistent manner.

### Guardian cookstove methodology

This methodology demonstrates how rigorous methodologies can be executed within open verification workflows. Explore the methodology in practice through our [cookstove case study video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQRoSuIp5UE&t=81s). Our exeprience 


### Adaptation methodology

The  extends the platform beyond mitigation use cases. A worked example with real project data is available in the [Adaptation Methodology reference](/References/Methodology.pdf).

- **Publication of AIAO** â€“ formal release of the ontology to the wider community in September 2025, establishing shared language for anthropogenic impact.
