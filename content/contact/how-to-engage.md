## Submission channels

Until we publish dedicated intake forms, reach us at [info@independentimpact.org](mailto:info@independentimpact.org). In your message, let us know:

- Whether you want to publish a new project, propose a methodology, or join the validator network.
- Which regions or sectors you operate in and any language considerations we should be aware of.
- If there are sensitive datasets or privacy requirements we should plan for.
- For greenhouse gas methodology questions or collaboration, join the [GHG Methodologies discussions](https://github.com/IndependentImpact/GHG_methodologies/discussions).
- For Guardian API automation topics, participate in the [Guardener discussions](https://github.com/IndependentImpact/Guardener/discussions).
- For Hedera ontology feedback or modelling ideas, use the [Bhash discussions](https://github.com/IndependentImpact/Bhash/discussions).
- For Web3.Storage CLI integrations, share input in the [w3cli discussions](https://github.com/IndependentImpact/w3cli/discussions).

## What happens next

We review submissions on a rolling basis and match them with reviewers who have relevant reputation. You will receive guidance on:

- Preparing artefacts for IPFS or other content-addressed storage.
- Setting up verifiable compute pipelines where quantitative analysis is required.
- Navigating reputation thresholds for validation, verification, and publication.

Ready to collaborate? Send us your details and we will guide you through the Independent Impact onboarding process.
