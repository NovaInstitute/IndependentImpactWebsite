## Join the Independent Impact Community

Independent Impact is designed for mass participation. Whether you build projects on the ground, review methodologies, or validate data, there is a pathway for you to contribute to verifiable human impact.

### How You Can Contribute

- **Implementers** bring forward projects and interventions, documenting their plans and results so they can be evaluated transparently.
- **Validators** review project design documents and methodologies to confirm that the proposed evidence and controls are sound.
- **Verifiers** examine outcomes, data provenance, and adherence to methodologies before credentials and tokens are issued.
- **Methodology developers** craft and refine the frameworks that other participants rely on.

### Working Principles

- Openness to new participants paired with reputation requirements that protect quality.
- Peer review at every stage so contributions stay accountable and communities learn from each other.
- Transparent histories for artefacts and credentials so buyers and partners know exactly what they are supporting.

### Getting Started

_What onboarding process should new participants follow, and are there training materials we can link to?_ We will update this page with concrete steps once we gather that information. For now, please reach out via the contact details in the site footer and share how you would like to contribute.
