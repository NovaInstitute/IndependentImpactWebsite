## Understand the evidence trail

Regulators and funders can interrogate every artefact associated with a project, from raw data to validator credentials. Review:

- The reputation levels of implementers, methodology authors, validators, and verifiers.
- Event logs on the Hedera Consensus Service that show when submissions and approvals occurred.
- Supporting documentation stored on IPFS or linked repositories.

## Set participation expectations

Use Independent Impact’s governance model to mandate the assurance levels you require. You can prescribe specific methodologies, minimum reputation scores, or additional review steps that projects must complete before funds are released.

## Collaborate on roadmaps

Your feedback shapes what we prioritise next—whether you need domain-specific methodologies, tailored reporting dashboards, or integrations with regulatory systems. _Which capabilities would help you provide oversight more effectively?_ [Reach out](/contact/how-to-engage/) so we can align our roadmap with your requirements.
