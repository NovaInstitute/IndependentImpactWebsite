## What field verifiers do

Field verifiers document on-the-ground activity so validators and funders can trust that implementation matches reported outcomes. Typical tasks include:

- Capturing timestamped photos, videos, or sensor readings using approved mobile tools.
- Collecting community attestations or survey responses that support reported outcomes.
- Verifying the existence and condition of assets, interventions, or programme participants.

## Preparing for assignments

Before accepting an assignment, review:

- The methodology, indicators, and assurance requirements in scope.
- Instructions on how to package and upload evidence (including file formats and naming conventions).
- The reputation and roles of other project contributors so you can coordinate efficiently.

Independent Impact is piloting dedicated mobile capture tools that publish evidence directly to IPFS with cryptographic proofs of origin. Until that tooling is broadly available, follow the documentation provided by project developers to ensure artefacts can be verified.

## Building your reputation

Consistent, high-quality submissions strengthen your reputation on the platform. Respond to validator questions, address corrective action requests promptly, and log detailed notes about what you observed in the field.
