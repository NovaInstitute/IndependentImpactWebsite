## Define transparent methods

Methodology creators shape how impacts are measured, audited, and compared. When drafting a methodology, document:

- **Scope and intent** – Describe the interventions and outcomes the methodology covers, including any sector or geography constraints.
- **Indicators and metrics** – Specify the quantitative and qualitative indicators required, along with formulas or models used to derive results.
- **Assurance controls** – Identify the evidence, data quality checks, and validation procedures validators should expect.
- **Reputation prerequisites** – Outline the levels of reputation or experience that validators and verifiers should hold before applying the methodology.

## Collaborate with peers

Methodologies evolve through community review. Share drafts with validators, implementers, and subject experts to capture feedback on feasibility and assurance depth. Independent Impact records proposed changes, comments, and approvals so downstream users understand the debate behind every control.

## Publish and maintain

Once a methodology is approved, publish it as a verifiable credential so others can trust its provenance. Maintain a change log for future iterations and flag any contexts where the methodology should not be applied.
