## Start with transparent design

Independent Impact welcomes projects that can articulate how activities lead to measurable human outcomes. When you submit a Project Design Document (PDD), explain:

- The communities you collaborate with and how they shape priorities.
- The impact indicators and methodologies you plan to apply.
- Data collection plans, including how evidence will be captured and stored immutably.
- The reputation you or your partners already hold on the platform.

## Prepare your submission package

Every PDD should be accompanied by verifiable artefacts. Recommended inclusions are:

1. **Baseline evidence** – Surveys, sensor datasets, or verified attestations captured before activities begin.
2. **Implementation plans** – Schedules, budgets, and responsible parties that demonstrate feasibility.
3. **Safeguards** – Policies and community agreements that show how you protect participants and mitigate unintended consequences.
4. **Evaluation pathways** – How validators, verifiers, or auditors can re-run calculations, review documentation, and issue credentials.

Independent Impact uses Hedera Consensus Service for event journaling and IPFS for documentation storage, so keep structured data and supporting files ready for distributed publication.

## Build and maintain reputation

Project developers earn reputation when peers confirm that submitted claims are complete, well-documented, and aligned with the agreed methodology. Strengthen your reputation by:

- Participating in post-submission reviews and updating artefacts when new evidence becomes available.
- Sharing adaptations to methodologies when local realities require contextual adjustments.
- Mentoring new developers so that community knowledge compounds across regions.

Have a project to share? Start by creating an account at [app.independentimpact.org](https://app.independentimpact.org) and prepare your artefacts. When you are ready, [contact the team](/contact/how-to-engage/) so we can help route your submission to the right validators.
